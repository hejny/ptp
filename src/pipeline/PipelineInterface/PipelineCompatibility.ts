 * Level of compatibility between two pipelines or pipeline interfaces

 * - `IDENTICAL_INTERFACE` - pipelines have identical interfaces
 * - `IDENTICAL_NAMES` - pipelines have identical names in the interfaces
 * - `INTERSECTING` - pipelines have intersecting interfaces
 * - `NON_INTERSECTING` - pipelines have non-intersecting interfaces
