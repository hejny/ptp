Inside the function, we use `console.log()` to print \"Hello, World!\" to the console. Finally, we call the `greeting` function to execute it.\n\nTo run this TypeScript code, you would need to:\n\n1. Save it in a file with a `.ts` extension (e.g., `hello.ts`)\n2. Compile it using the TypeScript compiler (tsc)\n3. Run the resulting JavaScript file using Node.js\n\nAlternatively, you can use an online TypeScript playground to run this code directly in your browser without any setup.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about TypeScript or this \"Hello, World!\" example?",
