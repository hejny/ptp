### Result

```
Pavol Hejn√Ω, the AI whisperer and TypeScript tamer, graces the TypeScript Developers Summit 2025 with his presence as a keynote speaker. This code-conjuring wizard specializes in weaving fully functional user applications from the threads of cutting-edge AI models. As a proud member of the Ainautes consulting group, Pavol spreads the gospel of generative AI across the globe like a digital Johnny Appleseed. His brainchild, WebGPT, is revolutionizing web page generation, making HTML cry tears of obsolescence. Before AI took over the world, Pavol birthed Collboard, the first Czech virtual whiteboard, and H-edu, electronic textbooks that educated tens of thousands of children (and probably a few adults pretending to be children). When he's not communing with artificial intelligences, Pavol moonlights as an ornithological code-whisperer for the Czech Ornithological Society. A true Renaissance developer, he juggles roles as lecturer, jury member, and mentor in countless competitions, leaving a trail of inspired coders in his wake. With a heart that beats in open-source rhythm, Pavol's GitHub is a treasure trove of digital wonders. At the TypeScript Developers Summit 2025, prepare to have your mind expanded, your code elevated, and your TypeScript transformed into pure magic.
