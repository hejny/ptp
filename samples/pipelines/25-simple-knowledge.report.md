### Result

```
Pavol Hejn√Ω, the AI whisperer and TypeScript sorcerer, graces the TypeScript Developers Summit 2025 with his enigmatic presence. By day, he conjures fully functional user applications using cutting-edge AI models; by night, he communes with digital birds for the Czech Ornithological Society. As a proud member of the Ainautes, Pavol traverses the globe, sprinkling generative AI fairy dust wherever he goes. His brainchild, WebGPT, turns mere mortals into web development demigods. In a past life, he birthed Collboard and H-edu, virtual marvels that educated countless Czech younglings. When not channeling the spirits of open-source, Pavol moonlights as a conference sage, competition jury mystic, and mentor to aspiring code wizards. Rumor has it, his GitHub repository is actually a portal to another dimension. At the TypeScript Developers Summit 2025, Pavol will reveal the secrets of the universe, or at least how to use TypeScript with the latest AI models - whichever comes first.
