### Result

```
Pavol Hejn√Ω, the AI whisperer and TypeScript wizard, is set to dazzle attendees at the TypeScript developers summit 2025. When he's not busy teaching birds to code in TypeScript, Pavol spends his days crafting mind-bending user applications that make AI models question their own existence. As a proud member of the Ainautes consulting group, he travels the world, leaving a trail of awestruck developers and slightly confused AI assistants in his wake. Pavol's latest brainchild, WebGPT, is rumored to be so advanced that it can generate entire websites faster than you can say "npm install." Before embracing the AI revolution, he created Collboard and H-edu, proving that even Czech children could outsmart virtual whiteboards. When he's not busy saving the world one line of TypeScript at a time, Pavol can be found judging coding competitions with an iron fist and a twinkle in his eye. His GitHub is a treasure trove of open-source wonders, each project more perplexing than the last. At the summit, Pavol plans to unveil his latest creation: a TypeScript-powered AI that can predict the future of JavaScript frameworks, much to the chagrin of framework developers everywhere.
