### Result

```
Pavol Hejn√Ω, the AI whisperer and TypeScript tamer, graces the TypeScript developers summit 2025 with his presence as a keynote speaker. This code-slinging maverick is not your average developer - he's the mastermind behind WebGPT, a web page generation service that makes AI dance to the tune of HTML. When he's not busy revolutionizing the digital landscape with Ainautes, Pavol can be found reminiscing about his days as the creator of Collboard, the first Czech virtual whiteboard that made chalk obsolete. A true polymath, he's as comfortable decoding bird behavior for the Czech Ornithological Society as he is decoding complex algorithms. Pavol's GitHub is a treasure trove of open-source goodies, proving that sharing is indeed caring in the world of code. At the TypeScript developers summit 2025, he plans to ruffle some feathers with his cutting-edge ideas on AI integration in TypeScript, promising an experience as exhilarating as teaching a computer to yodel.
