@mattpocock this is the second PR, which compared to https://github.com/ai-hero-dev/ai-hero/pull/5 is less clear whether it should be merged or not, because its not about technical debt but more about your target audience, but I think it should ðŸ˜ƒ

Most of the examples you show there present and explain the hard stuff - like RAG, embedding, index DBs, system messages, chains, agents, function calls,... but from my experience there is a huuuuge gap between

*"I'm a programmer using ChatGPT*"*

to ->

*"I will integrate the language model with all its cool features into the code base!"*.

---

Everything starts at point 1, missing the point 0:

*"I'm going to take this prompt that works in ChatGPT* and make this word a `{parameter}` and integrate the language model into the codebase"*.

---

And we think that the promptbook fits very well as point 0 - as a logical step between prompting and programming.

- But maybe this is not your intention and your audience is different, if so, consider this irrelevant
- \* I mean ChanGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini,... whatever model and UI the customer is using.
