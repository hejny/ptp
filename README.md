## Concept

When you have a simple single prompt in GPT / ChatGPT, it doesn't matter how it is integrated, whether it's direct calling of Rest API or using Open Ai library and hardcoding prompt in source code or importing text file.

If you need something more advanced or want to extend the capabilities of LLMs, you generally have 3 ways to come:

1. **Fine-tune** the model to your perfection or even train your own.
2. **Tune** the prompt to your perfection
3. Use **multishot** approach with multiple prompts to get the best result

In any of these situations, this library can make your life easier:

-   **Separation of concerns** between prompt engineer and programmer; between code files and prompt files; and between prompts, templates, templating pipelines, and their execution logic.
-   Set up a **common format** for prompts that is interchangeable between project and language/technology stacks.
-   Simplify your code to be **DRY** and not repeat all the boilerplate code for each prompt.
-   **Versioning** of prompt template pipelines
-   **Reuse** parts of prompt template pipelines in/between projects
-   **Logging** the results of the prompt template pipelines
-   **Caching** calls to LLMs to save money and time
-   **A/B testing** to determine which prompt works best for the job
-   Leverage the **streaming** to make super cool UI/UX

# 👁‍🗨 Language Capabilities

Trying the language capabilities of GPT models.

## Synonym

Write synonym for "{word}"

-> removeQuotes -> {wordSynonym}

## Sentence with Synonym

Write sentence with "{word}" and "{wordSynonym}" in it

-> {sentenceWithTwoSynonyms}

## Sentence without original word

Remove word "{word}" from sentence and modify it so that it makes sense:

### Rules:

-   Sentence must be grammatically correct
-   Sentence must make sense after removing the word

#### The Sentence:

> {sentenceWithTwoSynonyms}

-> {sentenceWithOriginalWordRemoved}

## Comparison

### Requirements:

-   Use GPT-4

---

Compare meaning of thee two sentences:

### Sentence 1:

> {sentenceWithTwoSynonyms}

### Sentence 2:

> {sentenceWithOriginalWordRemoved}

-> {comparisonOfTwoSentences}
```

## Dictionary

The following glossary is used to clarify certain basic concepts:

### Prompt

Prompt in a text along with model requirements, but without any execution or templating logic.

For example:

```json
{
    "request": "Which sound does a cat make?",
    "modelRequirements": {
        "variant": "CHAT"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "request": "I am a cat.\nI like to eat fish.\nI like to sleep.\nI like to play with a ball.\nI l",
    "modelRequirements": {
        "variant": "COMPLETION"
    }
}
```

### Prompt Template

Similar concept to Prompt, but with templating logic.

For example:

```json
{
    "request": "Which sound does a {animalName} make?",
    "modelRequirements": {
        "variant": "CHAT"
    }
}
```

### Model Requirements

Abstract way to specify the LLM.
It does not specify the LLM with concrete version itself, only the requirements for the LLM.
_NOT chatgpt-3.5-turbo BUT CHAT variant of GPT-3.5._

For example:

```json
{
    "variant": "CHAT",
    "version": "GPT-3.5",
    "temperature": 0.7
}
```

### Prompt Template Params

Parameters that are placed in the prompt template and replaced to create the prompt.
It is a simple key-value object.

```json
{
    "animalName": "cat",
    "animalSound": "Meow!"
}
```

There are three types of template params, depending on how they are used in the prompt template pipeline:

-   **Entry params** are required to execute the prompt template pipeline.
-   **Intermediate params** are used internally in the prompt template pipeline.
-   **Result params** are not used internally in the prompt template pipeline, but are returned as the result of the prompt template pipeline execution.

### Prompt Template Pipeline

Prompt template pipeline is the **core concept of this library**.
It represents a series of prompt templates chained together to form a pipeline / one big prompt template with input and result params.

Internally it can have 3 formats:

-   **.ptp.md file** in custom markdown format described above
-   _(internal)_ **JSON** format, parsed from the .ptp.md file
-   _(internal)_ **Object** which is created from JSON format and bound with tools around (but not the execution logic)

### Prompt Template Pipeline **Library**

Library of prompt template pipelines that groups together prompt template pipelines for an application.
This is a very thin wrapper around the Array / Set of prompt template pipelines.

Prompt Template Pipeline library is a useful helper in execution, it can be shared between execution and consumer parts of the app and make common knowledge about prompt template pipelines.

It allows to create executor functions from prompt template pipelines in the library.

### Prompt Result

Prompt result is the simplest concept of execution.
It is the result of executing one prompt _(NOT a template)_.

For example:

```json
{
    "response": "Meow!",
    "model": "chatgpt-3.5-turbo"
}
```

### Execution Tools

Execution Tools is a container for all the tools needed to execute prompts (template pipelines).
On its interface it exposes common methods for prompt execution.
Inside (in constructor) it calls OpenAI, Azure, GPU, proxy, cache, logging,...

Execution Tools is an abstract interface that is implemented by concrete execution tools:

-   `OpenAiExecutionTools`
-   `AzureOpenAiExecutionTools`
-   `BardExecutionTools`
-   `LamaExecutionTools`
-   `GpuExecutionTools`
-   And a special case are `RemoteExecutionTools` that connect to a remote server and run one of the above execution tools on that server.

### Executor

Executor is a simple async function that takes input params and returns result params _(along with all intermediate params and input params = it extends input object)_.

Executor is made by combining execution tools and prompt template pipeline library.
It can be done in two ways:

-   From `PromptTemplatePipelineLibrary.getExecutor` method
-   `createPtpExecutor` utility function

### Remote server

Remote server is a proxy server that uses its execution tools internally and exposes the executor interface externally.

You can simply use `RemoteExecutionTools` on client-side javascript and connect to your remote server.
This is useful to make all logic on browser side but not expose your API keys or no need to use customer's GPU.

## Usage and integration _(for developers)_

First you need to install this library:

```bash
npm install --save @gptp/core
```

## FAQ

If you have a question [start a discussion](https://github.com/hejny/ptp/discussions/), [open an issue](https://github.com/hejny/ptp/issues) or [write me an email](https://www.pavolhejny.com/contact).

### Why not just use the OpenAI library?

Different levels of abstraction. OpenAI library is for direct use of OpenAI API. This library is for a higher level of abstraction. It is for creating prompt templates and prompt template pipelines that are independent of the underlying library, LLM model, or even LLM provider.

### How is it different from the Langchain library?

Langchain is primarily aimed at ML developers working in Python. This library is for developers working in javascript/typescript and creating applications for end users.

We are considering creating a bridge/converter between these two libraries.

<!--
Include:
- jde naprosto hlavně o python knihovnu a JavaScript je tam na druhém místě
- je zaměřený primárně na dělání templates ne na spojování templates do větších struktur
- na úrovni jazyka rozlišuje chat a completion, já potřebuji tyhle dvě věci mixovat do jedné template pipeline
- pro neprogramátora je docela těžké s takovou věcí pracovat a template psát- já bych měl mnohem radši systém který umožňuje psát šablony i pro netechnické lidi ( kterých je na trhu mnohem více než volných pythonistů)
- Focus mého projektu je primárně zaměřený na budování uživatelských aplikací, nepředgenerovávání, zpracování dat, tréning či autogpt.
